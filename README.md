# FinalShowcaseGenerator

The purpose of this script is to go through a repository, get all the commits from its main branch (and their code belonging to it), then programmatically take screenshots to allow us to create a video timelapse of each file on a video grid.

To run the script, add the following arguements while running the script from the terminal:

$ all-git-commits -u <owner github username> -d <directory to save to on your computer (located in the same folder)> -r <optional - repo name to download> -n <optional - number of commits (not sure what this means but just leave it)>
